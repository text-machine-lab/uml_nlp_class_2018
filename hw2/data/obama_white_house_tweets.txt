Rice: We "can and must take action—carefully, responsibly &amp; purposefully—to reduce the chances of such an outrage happening again" #Syria
"We have seen what happens when the world fails to respond to horrific abuses on the scale we saw in Damascus." —@AmbassadorRice on #Syria
Rice: "By allowing Assad to act with impunity, everything else becomes even harder—from countering terrorism to defending human rights."
Rice: Limited strikes "will make clear to Assad and his allies—Hezbollah &amp; Iran—that they should not test the resolve of the United States."
Rice: "Our overarching goal is to end the underlying conflict through a negotiated, political transition in which Assad leaves power" #Syria
"Foreign policy experts from the left, right and center have strongly endorsed such action." —@AmbassadorRice on limited strikes in #Syria
"In #Syria, we have the undeniable proof that chemical weapons have already been unleashed with horrific results." —@AmbassadorRice
"This will not be Iraq or Afghanistan. There will be no American boots on the ground—period." —@AmbassadorRice on the need to act in #Syria
Rice on #Syria: "These would be limited strikes to deter the Syrian regime from using chemical weapons and degrade their ability to do."
Rice: "The reason Pres. Obama decided to pursue limited strikes is that we &amp; others have already exhausted a host of other measures." #Syria
"Failing to respond brings us closer to the day when terrorists might gain and use chemical weapons against Americans." —@AmbassadorRice
"Failing to respond means more and more Syrians will die from Assad’s poisonous stockpiles." —@AmbassadorRice #Syria

.@WBCHAMPION1 There is no general process for work permits.  Some people whose deportations are suspended may qualify, some may not. #whchat
.@MattOrtega Totally agree. The real solution is passing an #immigration reform. We need partners in Congress! http://t.co/9hk66qN #whchat
RT @MattOrtega: 300k reviews is nothing to sneeze at. "Progress but not enough." Others can't even see that and just exclaim "outrage!"  ...
.@javimorillo They adopted a strategy and it is having impact. ICE has increased criminal deportations 70%. This will help focus further.
RT @javimorillo: @whitehouse Do you have confidence ICE will implement new administration policy? #whchat
.@jvera15 If they are low priority, it decreases the likelihood that they end up in deportation proceedings. The real fix is the #DREAM Act.
RT @jvera15: So this new policy changes nothing for #DREAMACT students that are not in deportation proceedings? #WHChat
.@writegray: You can see the priorities DHS is using to clear out the caseload here: http://t.co/RcJQsaU #whchat
@Ivan_Garcia_214: To make any changes like that, we need partners in Congress to help us reform the #immigration law - a priority for us.
.@joseiswriting (2of2) impt to understand there's no affirmative process for people to apply for. For that we need imm reform in Congress.
.@joseiswriting: (1 of 2) We're clearing out the caseload to make room for high priority cases & keeping low priorities out of the caseload.
RT @joseiswriting: question: so you'd have to be in deportation proceeding to get temporary status? #immigration, #dreamact, @defineamerican

"... it is because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong." #SOTU
From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream. That’s how we win the future. #SOTU
"We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try." #SOTU
"I call on all of our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and the ROTC." #SOTU
"Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love." #SOTU
we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men & women who serve our country.
let us be clear: the United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia, & supports the democratic aspirations of all people. #SOTU
"In South Sudan – with our assistance – the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war." #SOTU
"we will work w/nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead. And this July, we will begin to bring our troops home." #SOTU
"Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency." #SOTU
"America’s commitment has been kept; the Iraq War is coming to an end." #SOTU
"tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America’s standing has been restored." #SOTU
"... both parties in Congress should know this: if a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it." #SOTU
In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government #SOTU
"We live & do business in the information age, but the last major reorganization of the gvt happened in the age of black & white TV." #SOTU
"the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code." #SOTU
"Before we take money away from our schools, or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break."
"we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations." #SOTU
"So tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years." #SOTU
"Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a government that does the same." #SOTU
"instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let’s fix what needs fixing and move forward." #sotu
What I’m not willing to do is go back to the days when ins. companies could deny someone coverage because of a pre-existing condition #sotu
"If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you." #SOTU
"Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you have some concerns about the new health care law." #SOTU

"I ask Congress to ... make permanent our tuition tax credit – worth $10,000 for four years of college." #SOTU
If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child– become a teacher. #SOTU
"after parents, the biggest impact on a child’s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom." #SOTU
"Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind" #SOTU
"When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance." #SOTU
"it’s not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair" #SOTU
"I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: by 2035, 80% of America’s electricity will come from clean energy sources." #sotu
"I’m asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies." #SOTU

We are the nation that put cars in driveways & computers in offices;the nation of Edison & the Wright brothers; of @Google & @Facebook #sotu
"The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation." #sotu
We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world. We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business.
we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea – the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny. #sotu
"The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn’t discourage us. It should challenge us." #sotu
"The rules have changed. In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work and do business." #sotu
"... to win the future, we’ll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making." #sotu
"We measure progress by the success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer." #sotu
What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow. #sotu

Later this summer there will be a transitional high risk pool for ppl who’ve been unable to get ins. b/c of preexisting conditions @dooce
By 2014, preexisting condition exclusions will be banned and everyone will be able to get coverage. @dooce
New law says no penalty for those who can’t afford insurance & provides tax credits & support for those who need it @dooce
@justinlfowler thanks!
No. In fact, the new law cuts costs for businesses. For example, new tax credits for small businesses: http://bit.ly/cYfeSl @dooce
The new law also saves money for large employers - here's a good study on that http://bit.ly/3J9BMB @dooce
@mjkidk that's an easy one: NO - if you like the insurance you have, you can keep it.
Yes, like physical health, mental health benefits are part of the essential health benefits package @dooce
We'll be watching insurers closely & encouraging state regulators to act. @dooce
If insurers jack rates up unreasonably, they won't be allowed into the new marketplace (exchange) where people can choose among plans @dooce
@jenleereeves we'll post a wrap-up post to the WH blog later today that pull all the messages into one place
@dooce you're welcome - this was a lot of fun! Take care, Nancy-Ann

Obama: “We did not ask for this fight. On September 11, 2001, nineteen men hijacked four airplanes…”
Obama: “Today, after extraordinary costs, we are bringing the Iraq war to a responsible end”
Obama: Afghan govt hampered by corruption, drug trade, economy, insufficient Security Forces
Obama: “Afghanistan is not lost, but for several years it has moved backwards… the status quo is not sustainable.”
Obama to troops: “As your Commander-in-Chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service”
Obama: “I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.”
Obama: “After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.”
Obama: "I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force"
Obama: “Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters”
Obama: “As President, I have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars.”
Obama: "So no – I do not make this decision lightly. I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake"
Obama: “We must keep the pressure on al Qaeda, and to do that, we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region”
Obama: “First… a military strategy that will break the Taliban’s momentum and increase Afghanistan’s capacity over the next 18 months”
Obama: “Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan. And now, we must come together to end this war successfully.”
Obama: “Second, we will work with our partners, the UN, and the Afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy”
Obama: "This effort must be based on performance. The days of providing a blank check are over"
Obama: “I want the Afghan people to understand – America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering”
Obama: “Third… our success in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan”
Obama: “the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government”
Obama: "we can’t simply afford to ignore the price of these wars... the nation that I am most interested in building is our own"
Obama: "America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars and prevent conflict, not just how we wage wars"
Obama: "we have forged a new beginning between America and the Muslim World... mutual interest in breaking a cycle of conflict"
Obama: "prohibited torture and will close the prison at Guantanamo Bay... respect for the dignity of all peoples...That is who we are"
Obama: “easy to forget that when this war began, we were united... I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again”

It's an honor to be in Accra & to speak to the reps of the people of Ghana. I am proud this is my 1st visit to sub-Saharan Africa as Pres.
The 21st century will be shaped by what happens not just in Rome or Moscow or Washington, but by what happens in Accra as well.
For just as it is important to emerge from the control of another nation, it is even more important to build one’s own.
Focus on 4 areas critical to the future of Africa & the dvlpg world: democracy; opportunity; health; & peaceful resolution of conflict
governments that respect the will of their own people are more prosperous, more stable, and more successful than governments that do not.
Africa doesn’t need strongmen, it needs strong institutions.
With better governance, I have no doubt that Africa holds the promise of a broader base for prosperity
Africans have to make responsible choices that prevent the spread of disease - promoting public health in their communities & countries.
America will support these efforts through a comprehensive, global health strategy.
Africa’s diversity should be a source of strength, not a cause for division
We must stand up to inhumanity in our midst. It is never justifiable to target innocents in the name of ideology.
I am particularly speaking to the young people.. Here is what you must know: the world will be what you make of it.
I can promise you this: America will be with you every step of the way. As a partner. As a friend.
Freedom is your inheritance. Now, it is your responsibility to build upon freedom’s foundation.

Obama: I have come here to seek a new beginning between the US & the Muslim world based upon mutual interest and mutual respect
Obama: throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality.
Obama:  Our problems must be dealt with through partnership; progress must be shared.
Obama: The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms.
Obama: In Ankara, I made clear that America is not – and never will be – at war with Islam.
Obama: America has a dual responsibility: to help Iraq forge a better future – and to leave Iraq to Iraqis.
Obama: America’s strong bonds with Israel are well known. This bond is unbreakable.
Obama: America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own.
Obama: the only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states .. in peace and security
Obama:The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons.
Obama: I strongly reaffirmed America’s commitment to seek a world in which no nations hold nuclear weapons.
Obama: The fourth issue that I will address is democracy.
Obama: America respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them..
Obama.. And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments – provided they govern with respect for all their people.
Obama: The fifth issue that we must address together is religious freedom. Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance.
Obama: Freedom of religion is central to the ability of peoples to live together.
Obama: The sixth issue that I want to address is women’s rights.
Obama: Our daughters can contribute just as much to society as our sons ..
Obama .. and our common prosperity will be advanced by allowing all humanity – men and women – to reach their full potential
Obama: Finally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity.
We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the courage to make a new beginning, keeping in mind what has been written.
Obama: The people of the world can live together in peace. We know that is God’s vision. Now, that must be our work here on Earth.
